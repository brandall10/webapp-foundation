# JavaScriptU Web App Foundation

This is the foundation, structure, and set of libraries we will build off of in future workshops.

## Contents

- LESS & Twitter's Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Modernizr
- RequireJS
- Jasmine with a RequireJS-ified SpecRunner

## Thanks

Thanks goes out to the maintainers and creators of all the above tools and software. Without all your work, we'd be stuck in the dark ages.
